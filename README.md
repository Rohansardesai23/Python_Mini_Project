Addition (a + b)

Subtraction (a - b)

Multiplication (a * b)

Division (a / b)

Modulus (a % b)

Exponentiation (a ** b)

Equality Check (a == b)

## 🔹 Option B – Multiple Number Input

### 🖥️ Usage

Run the script:
python pycal.py

Choose an option:

A. Two Number Input
B. Multiple Number Input


Follow the on-screen instructions.

Type exit anytime to quit the calculator.

### ⚠️ Notes

In Option A, division by zero is handled with an error message.

In Option B, expressions are evaluated using Python’s eval().

Only use safe numeric expressions to avoid errors.

Works with Python 3.10+ (because of the match-case syntax).
